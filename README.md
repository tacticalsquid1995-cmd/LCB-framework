# LCB(w): A Vector-Based Framework for Evaluating Linguistic and Moral Actions

A compact evaluative framework that models linguistic tokens and actions as vectors in a three-dimensional moral-operational space.

## Quick Start
- See `LCB_framework.md` for the full paper
- See `examples.md` for practical applications
- See `arrow_codes.md` for the symbolic notation reference

## Overview
LCB(w) maps each word or action to a vector representing its effects on:
- **L** (Life/Legitimacy): effect on dignity, trust, stability, moral standing
- **C** (Cost/Harm): resource expenditure, risk, burden, damage  
- **B** (Benefit): value creation, utility, positive outcome
v(t)= w_L x L - w_C x C x w_B x B
By treating words as force vectors rather than definitions, LCB(w) captures the real-world operational consequences of linguistic acts.

## Applications
- Governance & policy justification
- AI alignment & safety
- Ethics & moral philosophy
- Institutional transparency
